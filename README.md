# cs210
The goal of this project was to demonstrate and understanding of this course. This was done through being able to read a file and manipulate the information in different ways as that prompt stated. I believe my code and thought process in the project is easy to follow. I could enhance my code by making it purely c++ which may have been a better reflection of the class. I struggled inititally to understand how to create a histogram and had to look back and reaffirm myself in how to do it. Understanding C++ and time management skills are skills transferable from this project. I made this program maintable and readable by double checking my work and making comments that reflected what is going on in the program.
